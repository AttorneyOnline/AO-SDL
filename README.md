# tsurushiage
## A poweruser-focused Attorney Online client, with no guardrails

Tsurushiage is an Attorney Online client designed with fewer end-user features in favor of a simple and clean implementation of core functionality. Support for more niche or poorly designed AO2 features may be elided in favor of code simplicity. The aim of this software is to provide a reference implementation of the AO protocol(s). Full compatibility with AO2 is not guaranteed, nor is it a goal of this project.

This project is mostly intended as a testbed for the development of a set of core libraries which will implement AO2 logic
