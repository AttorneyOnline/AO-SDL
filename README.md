## A poweruser-focused Attorney Online client, with no guardrails

Saiban is an Attorney Online client designed with fewer end-user features in favor of a simple and clean implementation of core functionality. Support for more niche or poorly designed AO2 features may be elided in favor of code simplicity. The aim of this software is to provide a reference implementation of the AO protocol(s). Full compatibility with AO2 is not guaranteed, nor is it a goal of this project.

This client is rendered 100% in OpenGL without the use of any heavy UI frameworks or development libraries. Cross-platform functionality is implemented via SDL and some other support libraries.
